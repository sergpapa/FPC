All thxt on the website is using a variation of the "Rubik" font family found on [Google Fonts - Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rubik)

The colors chosen for the website revolve around three colors: eerie black, platinum and crayola orange. Orange as a color usually represents energy and vitality with the black tone gives the impression of elegance and simplicity. Additionally, dark tones provide a visually comfortable experience that minimizes screen fatigue and promotes extended periods of use.
