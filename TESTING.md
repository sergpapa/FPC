## **Known Bugs**

### **Resolved**

A console error was continuously thrown for a request of favicon.ico, although no such file existed in the repository.

![favicon-bug](assets/images/favicon-bug.png)

The following code found on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1321878/how-to-prevent-favicon-ico-requests) by [Sridhar Ratnakumar](https://stackoverflow.com/users/55246/sridhar-ratnakumar) and [Diego Perini](https://stackoverflow.com/users/445673/diego-perini) that seems to have resolved the issue:

~~~ html
<link rel="icon" href="data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=">
~~~

### **Un-resolved**

Performance testing on the [Gallery Page](https://sergpapa.github.io/FPC/gallery.html) with [Google Chrome Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) showcases poor results varying from 37-72%.

![Gallery-Performance](assets/images/performance-bug.png)

Actions taken: All images were converted from .jpg or .jpeg to .webp files in order to resuce size and payload. No significant result in performance. This bug does not seem to affect how quickly the page loads across devices.

## **Additional Testing**

### **Lighthouse**

The website has been tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) to test individual pages on:

- Performance - how does the page perform on loading?
- Accessibility - is the website accessible to all users?
- Best Practices - Does the code follow best practices?
- SEO - Is the pages optimized for search engines?
  
  An example of the Lighthouse results in the FPC home page is shown below:
